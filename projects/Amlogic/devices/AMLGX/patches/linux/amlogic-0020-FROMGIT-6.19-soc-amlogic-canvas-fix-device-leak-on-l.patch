Subject: [PATCH 20/56] FROMGIT(6.19): soc: amlogic: canvas: fix device leak on
 lookup

Make sure to drop the reference taken to the canvas platform device when
looking up its driver data.

Note that holding a reference to a device does not prevent its driver
data from going away so there is no point in keeping the reference.

Also note that commit 28f851e6afa8 ("soc: amlogic: canvas: add missing
put_device() call in meson_canvas_get()") fixed the leak in a lookup
error path, but the reference is still leaking on success.

Fixes: d4983983d987 ("soc: amlogic: add meson-canvas driver")

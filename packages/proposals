1 PKG_PRIORITY

None of the current scripts use the PKG_PRIORITY variable.
All but three packages set PKG_PRIORITY="optional". busybox, dbus and systemd
set PKG_PRIORITY="required".
The effect of PKG_PRIORITY is unknown.

Proposal:
Deprecate the PKG_PRIORITY variable


2 PKG_SITE, PKG_LONGDESC, PKG_SHORTDESC

None of the current scripts use the PKG_SITE variable.
create_addon is the only script that uses the PKG_LONGDESC and PKG_SHORTDESC
variables.
In other words, the PKG_LONGDESC and PKG_SHORTDESC are only used for
addons. For other packages, the PKG_SITE, PKG_LONGDESC and PKG_SHORTDESC are
merely informative and redundant.

Proposal:
Deprecate PKG_LONGDESC and/or PKG_SHORTDESC for normal packages


3 PKG_AUTORECONF

More than 330 packages set PKG_AUTORECONF="no", whereas about 230 packages set
PKG_AUTORECONF="yes".
build is the only script that uses the PKG_AUTORECONF variable.

Proposal: 
Modify build to set PKG_AUTORECONF="no" if PKG_AUTORECONF is not set in
in package.mk


4 PKG_LICENCE

Values of PKG_LICENSE are inconsistent among themselves and with the licenses in
/licenses.

Proposal:
Update PKG_LICENSE and /licenses


5 PKG_ADDON_REPOVERSION

The PKG_ADDON_REPOVERSION is set individually in the package.mk file of each
addon. The PKG_ADDON_REPOVERSION however pertains to the release of LibreELEC.
create_addon is the only script that uses the PKG_ADDON_REPOVERSION.

Proposal:
Define PKG_ADDON_REPOVERSION centrally with LibreELEC, modify create_addon
accordingly, deprecate PKG_ADDON_REPOVERSION in package.mk.

6 PKG_SECTION
The PKG_SECTION variable is only used by the build and uninstall scripts.
The build and uninstall scripts merely test if the PKG_SECTION variable is set
to virtual. 22 packages set PKG_SECTION="virtual".
When the value of PKG_SECTION is not virtual, it is arbitrary and inconsistent
with how the packages are grouped in the file system hierarchy.

Proposal:
Deprecate PKG_SECTION if not set to virtual

7 PKG_IS_ADDON
The PKG_IS_ADDON variable is only used by the create_addon script.
The create_addon script merely tests if the PKG_IS_ADDON is set to yes.
The PKG_IS_ADDON variable is therefore relevant for addons

Proposal:
Deprecate PKG_IS_ADDON if not set to yes

8 PKG_ARCH
The PKG_ARCH variable is used by scripts build, create_addon, install and
uninstall. These scripts test if the PKG_ARCH variable is set to a value
different of any, ie any is assumed by default.

Proposal:
Deprecate PKG_ARCH if set to any
